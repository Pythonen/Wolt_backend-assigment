# Wolt_backend-assigment

**Wolt** had [pre-assigment](https://github.com/woltapp/summer2020) for summer 2020 internship 


Made the backend assignment just for fun.

It is made with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)

The json contains restaurants and the task was to make REST API to list
restaurants with certain params. JSON file can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/woltapp/summer2020/master/restaurants.json)
